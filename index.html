    <h1 style="font-size:32px">Thank You from Both of Us</h1>
    <h3 style="font-size:14px"><br>We would like to thank those of you who attended our wedding! Thank you for being a part of this important time in our relationship!
    </br>
        <br>
        From our families who showed their love and support to our friends - Mike, Jason, Zach, Sarah, Will -  who helped us set everything up and spent tiring hours helping us out over 3 days. 
        </br>
        <br>
        To our friends - old and new - we hope the wait was worth it. 
        </br>
        <br>
        To our vendors - Melinda and Maddy, our wonderful DJ and photographers from MadLove, LLC, our event manager from UTEC, Marjorie, who stayed with us until midnight with us while we decorated and partied, and our caterer and servers from Julianas Catering from Sudbury who did an amazing job providing services to all our guests. 
        </br>
        <br>
        To Bright, Nour, VyVy and Veing who were our groomsmen and bridesmaids - who helped us with everything else in the background and chased everything down that we needed. 
        </br>    
        <br>
        Most importantly, to our parents (Rick, Sol, Seang, Yakehun, Vansan), who, without their love and support, we both would not be the people we are today. We love you all so much.
        </br>
        <br>សូមអរគុណ!</br>
