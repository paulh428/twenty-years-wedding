    <h1 style="font-size:10vx">Thank You from Both of Us</h1>
    <h3 style="font-size:13px"><br>We would like to thank those of you who attended our wedding! Thank you for being a part of this important time in both our lives.
    </br>
        <br>
        From our families who showed their love and support to our Dream Team -  Mike, Jason, Steve, Zach, Sarah, Will -  who helped us set everything up and decorated the venues over 3 days. 
        </br>
        <br>
        To our friends - old and new - we hope the wait was worth it after 20 years! 
        </br>
        <br>
        To our vendors - Melinda and Maddy, our wonderful DJ and photographers from MadLove, LLC, our event manager from UTEC, Marjorie, who stayed with us until midnight with us while we decorated and partied, and our caterer and servers from Julianas Catering from Sudbury who did an amazing job providing services to all our guests. 
        </br>
        <br>
        To Bright and Nour, who brought understanding and laughter and to VyVy and Veing, our sisters who have been with us the whole way, who were our groomsmen and bridesmaids, thank you for being by our side through everything!
        </br>    
        <br>
        Most importantly, to our parents who, without their love and support, we both would not be the people we are today. We love you.
        </br>
        <br>សូមអរគុណ!</br>
